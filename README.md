HelenaBOT is heavily inspired by [ShowTimes](https://github.com/ianMitchell/showtimes). It allows for fansub groups to track progress on their releases and publicly announce them (for now only on the Kaleido-subs Discord). It also has additional functions that I wrote for fun, like a damage calculator for Fate/Grand Order.

Note that this is primarily written as a learning experience. I have only recently started learning Python well enough to make an attempt at writing a bot, so don't get your hopes up too much. Feedback as well as pointers are always welcome, and I allow pull requests.
