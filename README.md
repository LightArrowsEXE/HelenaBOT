HelenaBOT is heavily inspired by [ShowTimes](https://github.com/ianMitchell/showtimes). It allows for fansub groups to track progress on their releases and publicly announce them (for now only on the Kaleido-subs Discord).

Note that this is primarily written as a learning experience. I have only recently started learning Python and MySQL well enough to make an attempt at writing a bot, so don't get your hopes up too much. Feedback as well as pointers are always welcome, and pull requests help a lot as well!
